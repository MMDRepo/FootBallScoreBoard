# FootBallScoreBoard
FootBallScoreBoard Project

Assumption made for this projects are given below.

This project will have a Score dashboard page where the games with home team and away team details will be displayed. For those games which are not started will be displayed with "Start Match" link or button. The games which are on going will be displayed with "Update Score" and "Finish Match" link or button. 

Here i'm using collection to store the Match data.

1. While clicking on the "Start Match", scores of Home Team and Away Team will get updated to 0.
2. Finish Match will delete the Match details from collection
3. Update score will update the scores as well as the  updated score time.
4. Dashboard will be displayed based on the total scores in descending-order and descending order of last updated score time.
